# HelloWorld
This is the first application that we looked at. It is separated into three parts: 

* Part 1 - Creating the basic application using a UILabel, UIButton and UIImageView. 
* Part 2 - Correcting the layout issues using AutoLayout constraints. 
* Part 3 - Adding a UITextField and handing the keyboard input.
