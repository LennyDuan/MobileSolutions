This area contains a project that illustrates the basic steps to use NSURLSession and NSJSONSerialization to access a JSON resource.  The code uses a completion handler to determine when the session request has completed. This completion handler is run on a background thread. The project also looks at the basic mechanism to run some code on the UI (main) thread.
