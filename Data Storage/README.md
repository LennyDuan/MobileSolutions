# Data Storage 
This folder contains projects that look at the different ways to store data. In particular, these focus on SQLite and Core Data.

## DataStore-SQLite-part1-Swift
This project illustrates how to connect to a SQLite database, access (select) information and update values. It also covers how to copy an initial version of the code from the Main Bundle and place it in the Documents folder. 

## DataStore-CoreData-part1-Swift 
This project looks at the basic elements of using CoreData in an application. The main class, ViewController, shows most of the key ideas for creating Entities, setting data and retrieveing data to modify the information. The FetchedResultsViewController class looks at the use of the NSFetchedResultsController to simply some of the work when using CoreData with the UITableViewController class.
